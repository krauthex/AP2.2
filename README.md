# AP2.2
a collection of python scripts and functions for the "Anf√§ngerpraktikum 2.2" at Uni Heidelberg. 
No guarantee on any results though!

I'm trying to follow the basic python coding guidelines.
If you don't understand what a function does or what my script does, feel free to ask and I'll add more comments
Also, new implementations may also be included, if you tell me what you want.
(Keep in mind that I'm quite busy with $stuff, so adding other features might take some time)

Experiment 253:
  - reading data from a txt file (or any other ascii file with data in columns)
  - fitting a polynomial function to the data (also useful for extrapolation)
